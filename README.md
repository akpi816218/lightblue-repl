Hey there, fellow developer!

You're welcome to mod this game, but here's a few things you should know:

- The levels are stored in an array called `GAME_LEVELS` in `levels.js`. The elements are as follows:
- `o`: coin
- `#`: wall
- `+`: static lava
- `=`/`|`: horizontally/vertically moving lava
- `>`/`<`/`v`/`^`: dripping lava
- `.`: empty space

If you want to add custom tiles, check out `game.js`.
Perilous mode is stored in a different directory.
Please keep the current credits there; you may add your own name or team though.
