Hey there, fellow developer!
You're welcome to mod this game, but here's a few things you should know:
- The levels are stored in a list called "GAME_LEVELS" in levels.js The elements are:
- o = coin, # = wall, + = static lava, =/| = horizontal/vertical lava, >/</v/^ = shooter lava, . = air
- If you want to add custom tiles, check out game.js.
- Perilous mode is stored in a different file (and currently broken)
- The flavor text is stored in a list in game.js.
- Please keep the current credits there, you may add your own name or team though.
